### 1. What is a VCS and why is it needed?

Version Control software (VCS) helps in tracking and managing the changes that occurs while developing the software.

Needs:
Easy to keep track of version.
Compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake.
Developers can collaborate.

### 2.Whats is the difference between a forked repo and a cloned repo?

Forking a repo makes a copy of entire project/folder available on the remote repo i.e on github.
Cloning a repo makes a copy enture project/older available on our local system.

### 3.Why do we create branches?

Allows the developers to isloate their work from others and later merge it .
Keeps the code in the main branch clean and up-to-date.

### 4.What is the use of fork if we can create branches?

Forking creates a copy of an existing process which is independent of original repo even if the repo is deleted in future we will have a copy of it .All these are not possible in branch
